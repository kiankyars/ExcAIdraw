1. **Sketch**: Draw freely on the 2D canvas
2. **Enhance**: Use the "Improve Drawing" button to refine sketches into detailed, polished drawings
3. **Transform**: Click "Make 3D" to convert your drawing into a 3D model
4. **Build**: Add your 3D models to the world by switching to the 3D World tab
5. **Iterate**: Edit and refine your 3D models by sketching or by writing a text prompt
6. **Export**: Export your 3D world with 1 click in a standard format (.glTF) to integrate with your pre-existing tooling
